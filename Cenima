Write a Java program to implement a cinema booking system. The program should allow the user to select between AM and PM shows, display the seating arrangement, and book seat. 
The seating arrangement should be displayed in a 5x2 matrix, with the rows numbered 1 and 2 and the columns numbered 1 to 5. Each seat should be represented by a 0 or 1, with 0 representing 
an empty seat and 1 representing a booked seat. The program should allow the user to book seat by specifying the row and column numbers. If the selected seat is already booked, the program 
should display a message indicating that the seat is not available. The program should also display the total price of the ticket, which depends on the row number: if the row is 1, the price is 200/-,
and if the row is 2, the price is 150/-. If all the seats are booked, the program should display a message indicating that the seating is completed. Finally, the program should allow the user to exit the system
